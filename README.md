# Dashboard__NILM

This project is a dashboard oriented to NILM (Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring) in development yet.

For the backend we use Python, the server is based on Flask.

For the frontend we use React, specifically a Template created by CoreUI. This is the link to download the template : [CoreUI Pro React Admin Template](https://coreui.io/pro/react)
